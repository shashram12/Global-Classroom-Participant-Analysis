# Global-Classroom-Participant-Analysis

The Global Classroom program is a virtual learning platform that connects students from different parts of the world to engage in collaborative learning activities. Students at UMD have the chance to engage in meaningful, easily accessible, and credit-bearing overseas experiences through Global Classroom courses.

The OIA dataset inlcudes Global Classroom database for the academic years 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 for four terms (fall, winter, spring and summer) with a total sample size of 1618. The study identifies several factors that contribute to the program's effectiveness such as the degree level pursued by the student, the diversity of participants with few demographic attributes like age, gender, race, ethnicity and citizenship. We wish to answer the questions in the prompt and examine how our chosen attributes vary over time/semester using Tableau.

The initial analysis shows that the majority of participants are enrolled in the undergraduate program. The study also reveals that gender differences in participation exist. In almost every term there are more female students than male students. There are racial differences among the participants as well, with individuals from a certain race having a larger presence.

The results demonstrate the potential of virtual learning platforms for promoting intercultural learning and fostering global competence. Through this study we aim to gain some useful insights and offer vital strategies that Global Classrooms can implement to further increase its outreach and student diversity.
